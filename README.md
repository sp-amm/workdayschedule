Work Day Scheduler Homework

Homework this week is to make a work day scheduler for standard business hours 9-5. Moment.js is used to display the time in 
the Bootstrap jumbotron header.  Timeblocks are required for each hour. These timeblocks are displayed as rows with the hour 
at the left. Moment.js is used to track the current hour of the day and to assign different colours to the current, past and 
future timeblocks. Input fields are required to take data about the tasks for each timeblock with a save button on the right 
to store input data into local storage. Tasks are required to be displayed upon refresh of the page.

All acceptance criteria as described below in the original Homework README Instructions are met.
