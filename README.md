Work Day Scheduler Homework

Homework this week is to make a work day scheduler for standard business hours 9-5. Moment.js is used to display the time in 
the Bootstrap jumbotron header.  Timeblocks are required for each hour. These timeblocks are displayed as rows with the hour 
at the left. Moment.js is used to track the current hour of the day and to assign different colours to the current, past and 
future timeblocks. Input fields are required to take data about the tasks for each timeblock with a save button on the right 
to store input data into local storage. Tasks are required to be displayed upon refresh of the page.

All acceptance criteria as described below in the original Homework README Instructions are met.

# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
